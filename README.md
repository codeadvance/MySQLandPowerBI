# MySQLandPowerBI
This project contains data mining, transformation, loading, visualization using MYSQL and PowerBI together

**Purpose**
I modified the project from a Youtuber called Codebasics to do a simplified demonstration on connecting data from MySQL to Microsoft Power BI. I demonstrated step by step tutorial in my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@learnlittlebit
This step by step tutorial video will help you to know which software to download to connect data into Microsoft Power BI as well as to generate, clean, transforming, and loading data into visualized charts from raw data.
